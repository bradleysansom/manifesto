                <p>This project originated in my Design Futures unit. I began to think about what led me to being here: what brought me to the world of graphic design. What even is ‘graphic design’? And why do I have a degree in it? I spent a while pondering those questions, and started to figure out my design origin story.</p>

                <p>Because I was never really comfortable with ‘art’. Even when I was a kid, when we’d get the paints out at school, I’d be the one sat in the corner designing a system of wayfinding signs. Always a designer, never an artist. On one occasion, I’d bedecked the classroom like it was a small branch of Asda, complete with ample ‘no smoking’ signs.</p>

                    I wasn’t any good at drawing, so really being creative on the computer became my outlet. Initially this was on PowerPoint. It was a time when WordArt was all the rage and I hadn’t yet discovered minimalism. Eventually I left Microsoft Office behind, and began creating things using code. I made my first webpage about a decade ago now. It was only editing some horrid template, but I became amazed by this hidden world where I could write some code and it transform into images, colours, and formatted text.

                    And over the following ten years, I’ve gradually become accustomed to working that way. I sort of think in CSS, even when I’m creating something that isn’t web based. Whether designing for print, screen, or web, I’m instinctively bound by what I know to be possible in the world of web. This has advantages as well as drawbacks; but overall, it’s led to me having a rather different perspective on graphic design to most other practitioners.

                    Over the same time, the web has transformed. Gone are the days when you’d design a webpage that fit exactly on an 800x600 pixel screen and proudly display a badge proclaiming the site looked best on Netscape Navigator. Nowadays it’s all about ‘responsive design’. You design something that looks good and functions on all manner of screen sizes and orientations.

                    When designing for the modern web, a responsive approach is universally recognised as being best practice. Other design disciplines, however, haven’t yet undergone such a shift. And I think that’s a shame. I’ve drawn up a manifesto for responsive design. It focuses on five different paradigms that are second nature to web designers, and distills them to their most basic forms that can be applied to any design endeavour. In this book, I will apply these principles in particular to brand identity design, though they are equally applicable to any specialism that would benefit.

                    The first point of my manifesto is about the process behind every design decision. I design best when there are restrictions, requirements, things that are in my way. If I’ve got free rein, that’s not design, that’s art. In web design, there very much is a correct route; there are very few ways of achieving the same thing, particularly when it comes to styling. And when that’s applied to brand design, a similarly systems-based approach is the most obvious route to investigate.

                        “I think all designers, especially identity designers, are thinking responsively - right from the start you’re thinking in concepts. You have to think beyond the digital device, because you’re going to have huge walls or tiny little things that you have to design. But this kind of thinking is something that is relatively new”

                <p>‘Responsiveness’ as a concept is second nature to web designers, and something that brand designers do consider too. But few theorists are yet exploring the intersection of the two, which is what I’ve been investigating in this project. Often that means taking a systems-based approach, of the type perhaps best described by Martin Lorenz. In his book Flexible Visual Systems, he set out his proposal for a shift in the way designers think about identity design. A process-driven design system, with clear steps for producing any sort of application, is the way forward.</p>

                <p>At its heart, a systems-based approach reduces everything to inputs and outputs. You have the content and the design, you push that through the design system, and out pops the design solution. But it’d be wrong to suggest that such a reductive analogy represents the realities of identity design completely. There will always be edge cases. However, a system ought to be able to account for that - design it right, and it will.</p>

                <p>The second tenet – adaptability – is about the ability of a design to work across different mediums. The reasoning behind a design should be consistent regardless of format or size, therefore the changes needed to adapt a design will be minimal. In responsive web design, pages are built ‘mobile first’ – you build it for the smallest screen first, and then iterations are made which alter the positioning of particular elements as the available space grows, adapting the design to suit but nevertheless retaining the same DNA. And in brand design, this is even more important – from the outset, identities need to be designed with the understanding that they’ll exist on everything from an app icon to an articulated lorry. And ‘just slap the logo on’ isn’t good enough.</p>

                <p>There was a trend a few years back for brands to have a ‘responsive logo’; that being one that has different ‘optical sizes’ with different levels of detail depending on space available. The illusion is meant to be that the logo appears the same but has a level of detail that adapts for the space available. In 2018, the agency SomeOne did the rebrand of the UK Parliament. They produced a lovely detailed version of the portcullis symbol, and then created versions which stripped out levels of detailing so that a more performant version of the logo could be used depending on how much space was available.</p>

                <p>This isn’t a new development – in type design, there’s the concept of ‘optical size’, where different versions are made of a font with varying levels of detail. Nor is it new to brand design either – even in the lovely old British Rail identity from the 1960s, there were two versions of the double arrows, which were used either in ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ depending on whether it was light on dark or dark on light.</p>

                <p>The idea was that you wouldn’t notice – the two symbols would appear the same, counteracting the visual effect that makes dark-on-light appear thinner than light-on-dark. The identity’s designers, the Design Research Unit, made a similar decision when drawing the Transport typeface used on British road signs. The weight used on white signs is bolder than the weight used on green signs, perversely to avoid people thinking it’s lighter.</p>

                <p>But the downside of there being different versions of the logos that are deliberately imperceptible is that even the designers tasked with implementing the identity can’t tell the difference. There are countless of examples of where the wrong version of the logo has been used, at which point it really becomes obvious that the bars are either too thin or too thick for the context. But only once you’ve seen them side-by-side.</p>

                <p>In 2022, the designer Nick Job was commissioned by the Department for Transport to redraw the iconic symbol. And after seeing all the ways in which the original double arrows logo has been misused, he decided to produce just one version, midway between the positive and negative versions. In an interview with blog Beauty of Transport, he said “In reality, one never sees the two versions next to each other anyway, and having a single version rather than positive and negative versions makes it considerably more practical for designers who no longer have to worry about which version to use.”</p>

                <p>Adaptive logos, like those previous examples, are one way of making a brand marque responsive. The alternative is to eschew any impression of having just one logo, and instead going with what’s been termed a dynamic logo. Of course, now that most things are digital, you can animate things. There’s not as much of a need to have everything totally consistent across every output. The pioneers of this sort of thing were the agency Moving Brands. But others have done similar things of course, like the famous logo for Casa de Musica in Porto by Sagmeister & Walsh – they didn’t build ‘a logo’, they built the software that makes the logo – taking the colours from an image and generating logomarks from a range of geometric impressions of the angular building.</p>

                <p>Ellen van Loon was the architect of both Casa de Musica and Manchester’s new Factory International. At a talk at the latter venue in 2023, she talked about her references, like Factory Records and Granada, which matched North and Peter Saville’s references when they were doing the brand identity. The architecture and the brand identity were intertwined from the beginning, before the building even existed. Both she and Saville appeared on a BBC documentary in late 2023, in which they reiterated how important the context of the site was to both of their creative processes. ‘Design’ as an aim is cross-disciplinary, not about everyone working in their own little boxes - those who wish to box people in as specifically ‘brand’ designers ought to recognise that no identity exists in a vacuum.</p>

                <p>The next area of my design philosophy is about accessibility. It’s not only about the obvious – large print, high contrast, that sort of thing. It’s about embodying equality in everything that I create. It’s avoiding making something that’s elitist, or exclusionary. Accessibility is a big thing on the web, generally it’s about making a design work for users with a range of needs, like visually impaired people who use a screen reader. And in branding, there’s even more to consider, not only digitally but in print, service design, experiences - everything.</p>

                <p>There’s a perception that making something accessible involves sacrificing on any sort of design flair in favour of a very functional, dull layout with huge print and basic fonts and colours. But that doesn’t have to be the case at all. Accessibility is about compromise. You’re never going to be able to make something that works for absolutely everyone. What’s good for one group of people could have adverse effects for another. But the aim should be to always keep these competing forces in mind when producing something, and trying to satisfy as many as possible.</p>

                <p>The fourth strand of my manifesto – functionality – is about how a branding system is actually implemented. When designing for the web, it’s best practice to develop the content of a site separately from the styling, such that both can be updated without affecting the other, so much so that they’re written in physically different languages, HTML vs CSS. And that split is something that I think applies to branding projects too. Not completely ‘form follows function’ in a brutalist sense, but not far off either. In branding, there naturally need to be functional rules about things like ‘where the logo goes’ and how big it is, what colours are used et cetera. Traditionally, that was done through a very strict, big document of brand guides, with hundreds of rules in it.</p>

                <p>The problem with that, in a digital age, is that those boundaries, of rigid sizes of things, don’t exist anymore. While in the past you’d typically make a static website for a specific screen resolution, nowadays you design something that adapts to fit the screen whether it’s a smartwatch, a mobile, a tablet, a laptop, a monitor, a projector, whatever. And that means that having a strict rule, “the logo has to be 20mm high” and suchlike, doesn’t work. This is one way – deliberately having a flexible system that understands from the start that it will end up being adapted. The branding system for American clothing retailer Nordstrom Rack, created by Jones Knowles Ritchie, has been designed with the recognition that what works on a shop fascia isn’t good for an app icon.</p>

                <p>On the flipside, a bad example would be the university. Their guidelines might be on a flashy website rather than a stuffy ringbinder, but that doesn’t change the fact that the rules within are really quite inflexible and ill-conceived. They’re specific about the sizes on paper – to a degree. But for screens - the rules just say “40 pixels minimum” . And forty pixels on a smartwatch versus forty pixels on a cinema screen is a huge difference. And that’s before you get to rules for things like merchandise, and wayfinding. It feels like it really hasn’t been considered as a proper branding system, and as a result, there’s no buy-in from designers, and so it gets ignored.</p>

                <p>These sorts of things need to be considered from the start when an identity system is being developed. The BBC have done that quite well, they altered their logo a couple of years back, they brought in the agency Wolff Ollins, who set out the pretty simple rule that, where possible, the logo should go at the top middle. It’s simple, but it means that it can be followed. It works well across aspect ratios too, which is important for a broadcaster. This is definitely a route to go down - a branding system where from the outset the realities of deploying a brand across different formats and sizes has been considered.</p>

                <p>The final strand is about practicality – measuring how successful a design is at doing its job. On the web, there’s a huge emphasis on testing. Analytics and UX are a huge business. But in the branding world, testing is often merely thought of in financial terms. There are plenty of examples of rebrands that backfired – think of when Royal Mail decided they were called Consignia for a year, but changed back when everyone still called them Royal Mail. Or the recent rebrand of the Portuguese government, abandoned when a new administration came to power. I suppose profitability will be what everything will come down to in the end, given branding is often in the service of making a profit – though there ought to be more recognition of the role of testing as a part of the design process itself. I asked Martin Lorenz about user testing, knowing he’s a technically minded identity designer. And he agreed, “the metrics are a little more intangible” when you’re doing branding rather than web. The feedback will be far more qualitative than quantitative.</p>

It’s commonplace in more technical environments, so why not in visual communication? If design is about using visuals to convey a message, there’s a simple test of how successful what you’ve made is – does it work effectively, or doesn’t it? And this is frustrating for me – someone who enjoys brand design but whose mind is much more technical.</p>

Often quickly. In his book, their founder Michael Johnson gives plenty of examples of designers that had ideas which hit the buffers once practical considerations were factored in. Like the redesign by Alan Fletcher of the V&A, which looked to improve navigation through the building through a series of colour-coded banners which would match the colour of that wing on the printed map. And then the accountants stepped in and decided to downgrade the map to a two-colour print, and now the “beautiful series of banners [make] little navigational sense”.</p>
